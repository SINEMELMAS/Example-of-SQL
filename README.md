### SQL: Structured Query Language

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for interacting with relational databases. It allows users to create, modify, query, and manage data efficiently.

#### Key Features of SQL:
1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used to define database structures. Examples: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.
2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used to manipulate data in the database. Examples: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
3. **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Used to retrieve data from the database. The most common command: `SELECT`.
4. **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Used to manage user permissions. Examples: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.
5. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**: Used to manage database transactions. Examples: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`.

### Example SQL Queries

1. **Creating a Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name VARCHAR(100),
       Email VARCHAR(100),
       CreatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

2. **Inserting Data**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Customers (ID, Name, Email)
   VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
   ```

3. **Querying Data**
   ```sql
   SELECT Name, Email
   FROM Customers
   WHERE CreatedAt > '2025-01-01';
   ```

4. **Joining Tables**
   ```sql
   SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.Name, Orders.Total
   FROM Orders
   INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.ID;
   ```
